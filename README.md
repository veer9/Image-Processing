## Projects


- [Epsilon Photography](/A2-Epsilon_Photography)

The goal of this project is to experiment with *Epsilon Photography*, which is a technique for capturing multiple images of a scene -- each with a slight (i.e., "epsilon") variation of the camera parameters -- then fusing them to produce a novel image.


- [Camera Obscura](/A3-Camera_Obscura)

The goal of this project is to learn about the operation of a camera by performing an experiment where you are _inside_ the camera yourself. Modern cameras -- including high-end DSLRs -- are simply more advanced versions of a camera obscura (also known as a pinhole camera). In this project, I created my own camera obscura and documented the construction and operation of the camera.


- [Pyramid Blending]

This project is about putting together a pyramid blending pipeline that will allow to combine separate images into a seamlessly blended image. The technique is based on the paper [“A multiresolution spline with application to image mosaics”](http://persci.mit.edu/pub_pdfs/spline83.pdf) (Burt and Adelson; ACM 1983)


- [Panoramas]

In this project, a pipeline was put together to align and stitch panoramas from image sequences. See the paper ["Recognizing Panoramas"](http://matthewalunbrown.com/papers/iccv2003.pdf). (Brown and Lowe; 2003)


- [High Dynamic Range Photography]

This project focuses on the core algorithms behind computing HDR images based on the paper [“Recovering High Dynamic Range Radiance Maps from Photographs”](http://www.pauldebevec.com/Research/HDR/debevec-siggraph97.pdf). (Debevec & Malik; SIGGRAPH 1997)


- [Video Textures]

The purpose of this project is creating video textures, or infinitely looping pieces of video. These are basically gifs with very smooth transtitions. The process is also described in [Video Textures](http://cs.colby.edu/courses/F07/cs397/papers/schodl-videoTextures-sig00.pdf). (Scholdl, et al; SIGGRAPH 2000)


- [Seam Carving]

The goal of this project is to independently replicate the results of the seam carving paper - Seam Carving Implementation by M. Alnammi.


- [Gray2Colors]

The scope is to implement the colorization algorithm for still images as detailed in the paper Colorization Using Optimization by Levin et all [1]
